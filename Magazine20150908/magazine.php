				 <br><br> <h4><q>R-Type, the best type</q></h4><br>

				<div class=artLeftRightWrap>  					 
					<div class="artLeft"><div class="blogParagraph">In the 1950s, cars with 115 mph top speed were rarely seen. With a little creativity and hard work 
				Ivan Evernden reinvented the style of Bentley adding speed to design made to handle elegance, speed and weight. The new R-Type Continental was created for 120 mph cruising speeds including luggage and all the seats occupied. Creating a low and long body shape, with wheel covers at the sides and steep back roofline the car has an amazing look. Adding fins to the sides just improved the stability hitting high speeds making the new Bentley an exclusive car you can take a ride with all around continental Europe.

					<div class=artLeftRightWrap>  					 
							 <div class="artLeft">In 1856 Villeroy &#8211; Boch completed the interior design of the Dresden diary shop (Dresdener Milchladen), still one of the most famous sights in Dresden. In 1890 the company produced a floor mosaic for Cologne cathedral. This mosaic is around 1300 square metres, took 5 years to produce, and can still be seen today. Villeroy &#8211; Boch supplied many famous places, in particular the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow.  The tiles can still be found in other historic locations, such as the Holland Tunnel that links Manhattan Island with the mainland or New Jersey.  In 1899, the Russian Tsar Nicholas II travelled in luxury on a royal train to Germany with his family.

<div class="blogParagraph" style="padding-top:15px"> The court and even two royal cows, who were taken to provide the royal family with milk, had a wonderful luxurious accommodation in a carriage fitted with the robust 
							 Mettlach tiles in blue and white. These tiles were also used on the Titanic, and fragments of them were rescued from the depths of the ocean.

<div class="blogParagraph">Antique Villeroy &#8211; Boch tiles can be bought today for typically &pound;15-&pound;30, but if you come across one that you can prove had been on the Titanic or the Tsar&#39;s train, it would be worth much more.  Good hunting!</div>

<div class="blogParagraph">100 000 years ago jewellery already remained part of human history when people started to use clothes and tools for the first time. Jewellery were produced from any kind of materials and while technology was getting more advanced people could turn metals and precious gems into work of art. That development influenced culture and jewellery styles.</div>
<div class="blogParagraph">The history of early jewellery development is divided to three ancient civilizations: Egypt, India and China. The first evidence of jewellery making is dating back to the Pre-dynastic Period in 3100 BC. In that time jewellery was symbolizing power and religious power in the society. Jewellery was worn during the life by Egyptians as well as in death and Egyptians were placed in it in grave. Both men and women wore jewellery and it was not only as a symbol of wealth and status, but also as a protection from evil and for aesthetic adornment. Egyptians preferred gold from range of metals and it was used extensively as well as bronze during that period.</div>


<div class="hiddenTextBlog hiddenTextBlog5">
<div class="blogParagraph">Egyptians used coloured glass and semi-precious gems in jewellerys. The so-called <q>Egyptian faience</q>, known as <q>tjehnet</q> (brilliant) was unintentiously created to resemble precious stones, such as turquoise and lapis lazuli. That was the first invention of glass. Faience consists of glazed ceramic made from ground quartz or sand. </div> 
<div class="blogParagraph">But that mixture was very popular and the most popular colour of such items was a blue-green imitation turquoise. Some most favoured stones were lapis lazulim turquoise, garnet, carnelian, obsidian and rock crystal. Native Egyptian stones were emeralds and pearls which were most commonly used. </div>
<div class="blogParagraph">Noble Egyptians favoured necklaces, bracelets, belts, amulets, pendants, hair beads and other jewellery types. Jewellery were often decorated with the designs of scarab beetles, scrolls, winged birds, tigers, jackals and antelopes. </div>

                          <h2> Rococo French Furniture &#8211; the Palace of the Sun King or the boudoir of Madame de Pompadour?</h2> 
When you hear the words <q>Rococo furniture</q>, what image do they conjure up for you?  The state apartments in the Palace of Versailles or the bedroom of the French king&#39;s celebrated mistress?   The intricate work of the famous English cabinet maker Thomas Chippendale or the elaborate drawing room confections of eighteenth century French <q>&eacute;bonistes</q> like Antione Gaudreau?  Some of these images would be right, others not quite.  Read on!        
The Palace of Versailles was built by the French King Louis XIV. the famous Sun King, and is indeed well known for its opulence and the intricacy of its exteriors and interiors, but the style of Versailles is Baroque.   Rococo is a later trend, developed in the time of the Sun King&#39;s successor Louis XV, as a reaction to the constraints imposed on architects and designers by the strict rules of Baroque design.  The notorious courtesan, Jeanne Antoinette Poisson, Marquisse de Pompadour, was a big fan of the new style so award yourself a point if you chose her over Louis XIV&#39;s sumptuous palace.
Did you pick Chippendale for the second question?  Not a bad guess, because he was much influenced by the French design, but British rococo avoided the intricate excesses of the French style.  Perhaps he thought all those curves and mountings were just too sexy for the staid English temperament.  So another point of you went for the French ébonistes, many of whom were originally German.   Could their wedding cake styles have been a celebration of their escape to freedom in the land of wicked permissiveness?      


 <br><br><h3>WHAT DO ROCOCO ITEMS LOOK LIKE?</h3>
Rococo is a style which was applied widely: in architecture, in art, and in furniture.  
But it was above all an interior fashion.  This was because, after the death of Louis XIV, French high society moved back to Paris, a city already crowded with buildings.

							  With no opportunity to express themselves in new building, all the artistic imagination and effort was directed towards the inside of what was already built.

With no opportunity to express themselves in new building, all the artistic imagination and effort was directed towards the inside of what was already built.  <br>
							  And what an imagination!   Wide use was made of S and C asymmetric curves, gilt-bronze (called ormalu), surfaces curved in three dimensions (bombé), and the use of inlaid veneers (marquetry).   
Everthing had to be irregular.  For the rococo designer and craftsman, it was a cardinal sin to leave a straight line or a square corner anywhere.    
Another feature in chairs and sofas was upholstery, with elaborate patterned fabric which could be changed to suit the season and the design of the rooms. 
							 <br><br> <h3>COLLECTING ROCOCO</h3>
Rococo is unique stylish furniture which is combining the wild imagination of designers and high level of skills of the craftsmen who made the items.  
All passionate collectors could find the right item from that style which will garnish their collection. <br>
<br> Genuine 18th century pieces are hard to find, but there is a supply of later reproduction or <q>in the style</q> pieces from the 19th and 20th centuries. 
<br>You&#39;re still looking at several thousand pounds (or even tens of thousand) for an early sofa, but fortunately there are later Victorian examples which have the look if not the quality of the genuine 18th century items.  
You can get chairs sofas and tables from this era for starting at less than &pound;100 and up to a few hundred.  
If you want to have a bit of a naughty 18th century French look in your bedroom, it&#39;s not impossible.

                                <h2>From the history of English porcelain</h2><br>
By the18th century, English porcelain had received international recognition. Worcester, Chelsea, Derby, Bow, Spode and some others had become well-known names for collectors and ceramists.
But unlike continental European factories which were under the patronage of princely families, British companies operated on a commercial basis and their production programme was linked to the needs and whims of the market.
Founded in 1745, the factory in Chelsea released English versions of articles in what became known as the English Rococo style. 
Chelsea also characterized original tureens in the form of animal or vegetable dishes with floral ornaments as well as elegant perfume bottles, snuff boxes for pins and bonbonnieres. 
In 1769, the business was sold and merged with the famous Derby factory.
The Bow factory opened in 1744 and was one of the biggest British ceramic enterprises of the time. 
It is also sometimes known as "New Canton" with the release of chinoiserie (blue and white porcelain with the addition of bone ash), thus imitating the Chinese products exported from the port of Canton in southern China (modern Guangzhou). 
Bow was first to master the technique of imprinting on the porcelain surface. The company existed until 1776.
The Worcester Ceramic Factory (founded in 1791) became the first to produce tea and coffee sets with the addition of so-called soapstone. 
This was in the mass production style of Meissen, Sevres porcelain and Oriental, and such products were in great demand. 
Thanks to their skilful management and responsiveness to the market, the Worcester factory was very successful.
In the early 19th century, at their plant in Stoke-on-Trent (opened in 1776), J. Spode, the son of the original owner, is said to have been responsible for the company&#39;s success in marketing English bone china. 
This product, comprising a mixture of bone ash and kaolin, produced excellent artefacts in the Regency style.
The closest competitor was the Minton factory, an company founded in 1793. It is also known for its artistic ceramics in the later Victorian style.

							  <b style="font-size: 18px">The Teddy Bear &#8211; The Toy That Captivated the World</b><br><br>
							 
Popular culture in America tells us that the history of the <q>Teddy Bear</q> originated in 1902, created by candy shop owner Morris Michtom after being inspired by a cartoon by Clifford Berryman in the Washington Post involving U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt.   <br><br>
Theodore <q>Teddy</q> Roosevelt was known as a big game hunter and often went on hunting trips with his fellow politicians. While hunting with a party including the governor of Mississippi, he was the only man to have not yet located a bear.  Roosevelt&#8217;s assistants found a black bear, cornered it, and tied it to a willow tree for Roosevelt to kill. However, Roosevelt found this type of kill to be very unsportsmanlike and refused to shoot the bear. The story quickly spread throughout the country as newspapers reported on the President who wouldn&#8217;t kill a bear. These articles prompted political cartoons, including the one by Clifford Berryman which inspired Michtom&#8217;s stuffed bear named <q>Teddy&#8217;s Bear</q>.  Michtom founded the Ideal Novelty and Toy Corporation and became the first company to produce teddy bears. The bears gained worldwide popularity. <br><br>


<div class="hiddenTextBlog hiddenTextBlog4">
							<div class="blogParagraph">Around the same time, the Steiff Company in Germany began producing stuffed bears as well. This origin story centers on Richard Steiff, who, when visiting America, saw bears performing at a circus. These acrobatic bears gave Steiff the idea to produce a bear with jointed arms and legs and a rotatable head to allow for similar movement. He debuted his new toy at the Leipzig Spring Toy Fair in 1903. <br><br>
These original bears were typically made with wool mole hair, glass eyes, and velveteen pads. Both old and new bears are considered collectables, with some of the most desired having been and still being produced by the Steiff Company. Another well-respected, long-lasting company known for their bears is Bing. The earliest Steiff and Bing bears are today worth well over $1000 USD. <br><br>
 </div>

  <b style="font-size: 18px">What Did These First Bears Look Like?</b><br><br>
 
<div class="blogParagraph">These first bears had unique characteristics that help identify to which toymaker they belong. The Steiff bears had long, curved limbs. They were also embossed with an elephant on their button initially; eventually, the company transitioned to an unembossed button and then one with the name <q>Steiff</q>. The first Ideal bears created by Michtom are very similar to the Steiff bears, which can make identification difficult. However, Ideal bears have larger ears and pointed feet.
</div>
                              
							   
<div class="blogParagraph">These early bears were also designed to look like real bears more so than their modern-day counterparts. They typically have a longer nose and feature a hump on their back. The bigger the hump, the more likely you have an older bear. Manufacturers also often affixed labels to their bears, typically on a paw. These labels can help greatly with identification, even if they are partially worn away. A hand-sewn seam is also common for older bears, as well as stuffing made from wood shavings.  
</div>
<br>
 <div class="blogParagraph"><b style="font-size: 18px">Collecting Teddy Bears</b></div>
<div class="blogParagraph">Collecting these bears became popular in the mid-1960&#8217;s. 
The bears became more than just a child&#8217;s toy; they were popular among adults for collections as well. 
There are many brands of Teddy Bears outside the aforementioned brands of Ideal, Steiff, 
and Bing that are long-lasting and have produced bears that are today considered very valuable. 
Chad Valley Bears had long moleskin hair and limbs stuffed with silky fibers. J.K. Farnell & Co. is the 
first English bear manufacturer and is believed to have made the first Winnie the Pooh bear. 
These bears featured amber eyes and were often used in displays at the department store Harrod&#8217;s. 
Another one of these is the Merrythought bear, which is still produced today. Merrythought is in fact 
the only bear producer left in England. Schuco Teddy Bears, Boyds Bears, Care Bears, and Cherished Teddies are also valued, 
well-known bears in the marketplace.  Maybe you are another Jena Pang and your collection of teddy bears worth &pound;100,000?    
The price range can be from &pound;60 to &pound;1,500 or the toy you own might be worth of &pound;4,500 or &pound;15,000 like Jena Pangs collection.  
All types of bears are at <a style="color:orange;" href="http://luckylookers.net/antiquesuk/index.php">LuckyLookers</a> waiting for you to take a look! <br><br>

							  Porzellan - German, Faience - French, &#1060;&#1072;&#1088;&#1092;&#1086;&#1088; - Russian, Farfur - Turkish, Fagfur - Farsi.<br>
							  
							  Porcelain is a type of ceramics which is impervious to water and gas. Thin porcelain is translucent, non-porous and makes a pleasant sound when tapped.
							It possesses high physical integrity, chemical and thermal firmness and is an electrical insulator.<br>
							 It is used in the production of high-quality kitchen ware, art-deco and sanitary ware, electrical and radio-technical parts, corrosion-resistant apparatus in chemical technology, etc. <br> <br> Porcelain is the most noble and perfect of ceramics and was invented around the sixth century in China.
    
                               It arrived to Europe in the thirteenth century where it was reputed to be a superlative rarity. The methods of making it were kept stringently secret and it was only in the fifteenth century that the manufacture of and adapted form of Chinese porcelain began in Japan, while it was first made in Europe at the beginning of the eighteenth century by the Germans.
<br><br>
<div class="hiddenTextBlog hiddenTextBlog2">
							   <b style="font-size: 18px">Porcelain &#8211; European Gold of the 17th Century</b><br><br> 
							   
							   The monarch of Saxony, Augustus II of Poland and Lithuania was always short of money. He already had a strong interest in the Asian porcelain and spent a lot 
							   of finances buying new items for his collection. But Augustus II was not the only one in Europe who was collecting porcelain in that period. 
							   Another passionate collector was Regent Philippe II of France, Duke of Orleans, as well as Louis-Henri, Prince of Conde, and Sophia Charlotte, wife of King of Prussia Frederick II.
<br><br>							
As August II of Poland needed to fill his treasury he ordered Johann Friedrich Bottger, a German alchemist, to create gold for him, a task that later led to the invention of porcelain.
							It was a group of scientists who were working on porcelain creation, among them Johann Kunckler (1630 &#8211; 1703) alchemist, chemist and glass blower and inventor of golden-ruby glass. 
							Another substantive role in Bottger&#39;s life played Ehrenfried Walter von Tschirnhaus (1651 &#8211; 1708) who made Bottger stop looking for gold creation and pay attention to the secret of porcelain. 
							The mist which was called <q>Versatz</q> (<q>foundation</q> or <q>basis</q>) and contained half of kaolin (porcelain clay), white oxide of aluminium which did not melt, ¼ th of spar, 
							which worked as an agent of fusion and ¼ th of quartz. The most important in that fact is that Chinese porcelain from the modern point of view is a soft porcelain, 
							because in its composition is much less of kaolin (porcelain clay) than in hard European porcelain and its backing is going in the lower temperature than European porcelain.
<br><br>							
							<b style="font-size: 18px">Collecting Porcelain</b><br><br>  You can be passionate about any porcelain manufacture or have a selective collector&#39;s taste and be devoted only to a certain brand. That could be Meissen porcelain which prices for different items of different periods vary from very decent &pound;25 and up to over &pound;2,000. 
							If you value Wedgwood porcelain, the prices for the items from different periods can range between &pound;10 to circa &pound;9,000 per piece. 
							There are many more famous manufactures which made a name since the manufactures started their existence. 
							You can always find items for your collection in old pieces with history or get something with a famous name from a modern collection. 
							The valuable thing in buying an item from such manufacturers of any age is tradition. <br><br>

  <p style="font-size: 18px">A timeless style with traditions &#8211; what could be better for a real subtle connoisseur?</p>  <br><br>							 
							 <div class="artLeft">One of the most powerful and influential watch brands in history is Rolex. Founders Hans Wilsdorf 
							 and Alfred Davis had their headquarters in Switzerland. Since the beginning of their production Rolex 
							 created beautiful design watches with great resistance, endurance and functionality. Their collections 
							 were created for extreme conditions such as deep-sea diving, hiking and aviation among other extremes. 
							 During the course of time the models changed from different materials and different styles. When one talks 
							 about pricing it can vary from hundreds of dollars to thousands of dollars depending on the watch model.

							</div>
<br><br>
<div class="hiddenTextBlog hiddenTextBlog3">
The company was founded in 1905 as a London Branch and the original name of the company was Wilsdorf & Davis which later became the Rolex Watch Company. 
<br><br>
Back in time close to World War II there was a period in which Rolex started creating a specimen of watches in a more elegant manner. One of its greatest is Rolex Prince Elegante, one of the inspirational art deco watches of the 1940s. At the time it had a price of 1850 GB Pounds, it is a duo-dialed watch because of the separated second register, and it is so exact that even doctors used it to count the patient&#39;s heartbeats. It was at this time that the watches took a rectangular shape, unregularly seen in a Rolex because of its iconic circular shape that include diamond decoration, quartz movements and other aspects that helped the  multibillion dollar company Rolex SA to get its name on the top of the greatest manufacturing watch company in the whole world. Even today the duo-dial Prince is one of the most emblematic vintage Rolex watches in the market if it is well preserved and in good condition.
<br><br>

							   <b style="font-size: 18px">Collecting Rolex</b><br><br> 
							   
							   Rolex is a renowned wristwatches and accessories brand, known for their quality, exclusivity and cost. During the long history of the brand it became a status symbol.
<br><br>							
The early wristwatches were sold by the company to jewelers in Great Britain, the dial was marked then with their names and appeared on the counter. The earliest watches from the company of Wilsdorf and Davis were usually marked <q>W&D</q> inside the caseback. 
<br><br>
The trademark name <q>Rolex</q> was registered in 1908 by Hans Wilsdor in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland during 1908.  The Wilsdorf &Davis company moved out of Great Britain in 1912 due to taxes and export duties on silver and gold metals which increased the price.
<br><br>
The collection of Exceptionally Beautiful Diamond pieces was made by Rolex in the period of 1920s and 1930s. The items were with hand-wound mechanism and fitted with Silk Moire straps for the evening. The pieces made during that period are very special and reflect all the glamour of the Art Deco Period.
<br><br>
You can find pieces on auctions from that period for &pound;10,000 to &pound;18,000 and you can be lucky to get it for &pound; 8,000 - &pound;14,000.  You can find more expensive items from later periods, but the price depends on the decoration and material it&#39;s made of.
